# GitaGrip Crash Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was crashing when opened with large directories (like ~/Dev) due to race conditions and unprotected concurrent access to shared state.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Race condition in initial rendering** - UI tried to render before data was ready
2. **Concurrent access without synchronization** - Multiple goroutines accessing shared state
3. **Event processing before UI ready** - Background scan started immediately
4. **Nil pointer access** - UngroupedRepos could be nil
5. **No rate limiting** - Too many events overwhelming the UI with large directories

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Mutex Protection (Already Existed)
- Repository and group stores already had proper mutex protection
- No additional changes needed

### 2. Fixed Nil Initialization
- Updated Query service to initialize `ungroupedRepos` as empty slice instead of nil
- Added defensive nil checks in getter methods
- Changed `updateUngroupedRepos` to use empty slice instead of nil

### 3. Created Initialization Phase
- Added `Initialize()` method to coordinator
- Delayed service wiring and event subscription until initialization
- Ensures all components are ready before processing events

### 4. Delayed Background Scan
- Removed immediate scan from main.go
- Added scan trigger in UI's Init() method
- Ensures UI is fully initialized before starting discovery

### 5. Added Event Buffering
- Created EventBuffer to batch repository discovery events
- Processes up to 100 events or flushes every 50ms
- Reduces UI update frequency and prevents overwhelming

### 6. Implemented Progressive Loading
- Discovery service now processes repos in batches of 50
- Added 100ms delay between batches
- Allows UI to stay responsive during large scans

## Result
The application should now handle large directories without crashing, providing a smooth experience even when scanning directories with thousands of repositories.

## Testing
Build succeeded with all fixes in place. The app should now:
- Start without crashing on large directories
- Show repositories progressively as they're discovered
- Remain responsive during scanning
- Handle rapid event bursts gracefully
