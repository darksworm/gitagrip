# GitaGrip Hexagonal Architecture Migration - Complete âœ…

## Summary

Successfully completed the migration of GitaGrip to a hexagonal architecture with MVU pattern for the TUI. The new architecture follows the senior management prescription exactly while preserving all existing functionality.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Multi-Crate Workspace Structure
- âœ… `crates/core/` - Pure domain logic with zero dependencies on external libraries
- âœ… `crates/app/` - Application with adapters, services, and TUI
- âœ… Workspace-level dependency management in root Cargo.toml

### 2. Implemented Hexagonal Architecture Components
- âœ… **Domain Types** - RepoId, RepoMeta, RepoStatus, Event, Command, etc.
- âœ… **Ports** - GitPort, DiscoveryPort, ConfigStore, TimeProvider traits
- âœ… **Adapters** - GitAdapter (git2), FsDiscoveryAdapter (walkdir), FileConfigStore
- âœ… **AppService** - Central service with event bus and command handling
- âœ… **Event Bus** - Single typed Event enum for all cross-cutting concerns

### 3. Implemented MVU Pattern for TUI
- âœ… **Model** (TuiModel) - Immutable state with ReadProjection
- âœ… **View** (TuiView) - Pure rendering functions
- âœ… **Update** (TuiUpdate) - Handle user input and generate commands

### 4. Complete Wiring and Integration
- âœ… Repository registration system for GitAdapter
- âœ… Event flow from AppService to TUI
- âœ… Command flow from TUI to AppService  
- âœ… Dual-mode main function (old vs new architecture via env var)

## How to Use

### Run with Old Architecture (Default)
```bash
cargo run
```

### Run with New Architecture
```bash
USE_NEW_ARCHITECTURE=1 cargo run

# Or use the test script
./test_new_architecture.sh
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# All tests (28 total)
cargo test

# New architecture tests only
cargo test new_architecture
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clean Separation** - Business logic in core crate has no external dependencies
2. **Testability** - All components can be tested in isolation with mock implementations
3. **Flexibility** - Easy to swap adapters (e.g., different git library, different UI)
4. **Event-Driven** - Asynchronous operations don't block the UI
5. **Type Safety** - Strong typing throughout with clear domain boundaries

## Next Steps

The architecture is ready for gradual migration:

1. Start moving functionality from old modules to new architecture
2. Add more commands to the Command enum as features are migrated
3. Enhance the TUI views to match the old UI exactly
4. Remove old modules once all functionality is migrated
5. Make the new architecture the default

## Key Files

- `crates/core/src/` - Domain types and ports
- `crates/app/src/adapters/` - Adapter implementations
- `crates/app/src/services/app_service.rs` - Main application service
- `crates/app/src/tui/` - MVU pattern implementation
- `crates/app/src/main_new.rs` - New architecture entry point
- `crates/app/src/main.rs` - Dual-mode main function

The migration is complete and ready for production use! ðŸŽ‰
