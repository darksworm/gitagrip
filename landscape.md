Multi-Repository Management Tools and Their Features

Managing multiple Git repositories can be challenging, but several tools (CLI, TUI, and GUI) exist to simplify this. Below we survey existing multi-repo management solutions, highlighting their features and noting any gaps or missing capabilities.

CLI Tools for Multi-Repo Management
myrepos (mr) – Polyglot Repo Manager

myrepos (command mr) is a classic CLI tool by Joey Hess for managing many version-control repos (not just Git) under one config. You register each repo (which creates an ~/.mrconfig), then use mr subcommands to act on all or a subset
myrepos.branchable.com
myrepos.branchable.com
. Key features include:

VCS-Agnostic Commands: Supports Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Darcs, etc. You can run mr update to pull changes in all repos at once (with parallelism via -j flag)
myrepos.branchable.com
. Commands like mr commit, mr push, mr status work across different VCS backends uniformly
myrepos.branchable.com
.

Configurable Actions: The ~/.mrconfig acts like a Makefile for repos – you can override default commands per repo (e.g. use git pull --rebase for one repo) and define custom commands
myrepos.branchable.com
. For example, you might define a custom mr zap to pull from an upstream then push origin
myrepos.branchable.com
.

Advanced Automation: Supports conditional or scheduled operations (e.g. update a particular repo at most once every 12 hours), pre/post hooks (run an arbitrary command before committing), offline change tracking (remember failed pushes to retry later)
myrepos.branchable.com
. Repos can be grouped by creating “logical” meta-repositories with their own .mrconfig that includes others
myrepos.branchable.com
.

Missing/Limitations: mr is very flexible but entirely command-line and config-driven. New repos must be manually registered (though community scripts exist to detect unregistered repos). Its power-user features (multiple VCS support, custom commands) add complexity that purely Git-focused users might not need.

gita – Git Repo Aggregator CLI

gita is a Python-based CLI tool focused on Git only, aiming for a simple status overview and command delegation for multiple repos. It allows you to “register” git repositories and then run git operations across them easily
stackoverflow.com
. Notable features:

Side-by-Side Status Dashboard: The gita ll command lists all tracked repos in one view, showing each repo’s current branch and status. It uses concise symbols to indicate staged (+), unstaged (*), or untracked (_) changes, and color-codes branch names to show if a repo is ahead/behind/diverged from its remote
stackoverflow.com
stackoverflow.com
. This gives a quick overview of which repos have uncommitted changes or need pulls.

Bulk Git Commands: You can run a git command on multiple repos at once. For example, gita fetch will fetch updates in all tracked repos
stackoverflow.com
. Gita supports a “superman mode” to delegate any arbitrary git command or alias to all repos, as well as a “shell mode” for arbitrary shell commands in each repo
github.com
. This means you can effectively script multi-repo operations (like gita exec "git pull" or similar).

Grouping and Customization: Gita lets you group repos and define contexts to run commands on subsets. It also allows user-defined subcommands via a JSON config and customization of the status output (e.g. which info fields are shown in gita ll and what colors are used)
github.com
github.com
. This makes the tool adaptable to different workflows.

Missing/Limitations: Gita is a pure CLI; it requires using commands for everything (e.g. you must gita add new repos to track
stackoverflow.com
). While it provides a great textual overview, it doesn’t have an interactive TUI. Also, its focus is on viewing status and delegating existing git commands – it doesn’t itself provide high-level operations beyond what git can do (for example, it won’t auto-fetch periodically or help resolve conflicts, etc. – those tasks still rely on git itself). Users have noted that you must remember to add repos first, otherwise commands like gita ll show nothing
stackoverflow.com
.

mu-repo – Multiple Repo CLI by Fabio Zadrozny

mu-repo is another Python CLI tool (“mu” command) designed to ease executing the same git actions across many repositories
fabioz.github.io
. You register related repos once (it creates a .mu_repo file), then mu commands act on all of them from any subdirectory. Key features include:

Unified Git Commands: Mu-repo allows running standard git commands in all tracked repos at once. For example, after registering repos, mu fetch && mu checkout -b featureX will do those actions in each repo without needing to manually cd into each
fabioz.github.io
fabioz.github.io
. This ensures you don’t forget a repo when performing bulk operations.

Cloning and Grouping: It can clone multiple repositories in one go given a list or config
fabioz.github.io
, saving time on initial setup. You can also define groups of repositories and restrict commands to a group
fabioz.github.io
, which is useful if you have subprojects or microservices.

Helpful Shortcuts & Automation: Mu-repo provides shortcut aliases for common operations (e.g. mu co for git checkout with substring matching: mu co v1.2 finds branches containing “v1.2”
fabioz.github.io
). It has a mu upd command to preview incoming changes on the current branch (essentially checking if remote has new commits)
fabioz.github.io
. There’s also mu dd to diff changes across repos using external diff tools like WinMerge or meld
fabioz.github.io
. Another unique feature is mu open-url which can open the browser to create pull requests for multiple repositories at once
fabioz.github.io
 (helpful when you have same-named branches in each repo that you want to PR). For arbitrary tasks, mu sh "<command>" will run a shell command in each repo
fabioz.github.io
. Mu-repo supports running either in parallel or serially, with a config or env var toggle
fabioz.github.io
, and even has a bulk push (mu p -f to force push all)
fabioz.github.io
.

Missing/Limitations: Mu-repo is somewhat less known (fewer updates in recent years) and requires an initial manual registration step. Its features are powerful but focused on command execution; it doesn’t have a built-in status dashboard (you would still run mu status which essentially calls git status in each). Like gita, it’s CLI only (no interactive UI).

gr (Git Run) – Tag-Based Multi-Repo Commands

gr (also called git-run, a Node.js tool by @mixu) uses a tagging approach to manage multiple repos via one command
github.com
. You assign one or more tags (like @work, @clientX) to each repository, then run commands by referring to the tag. Notable features:

Tag & Execute: After tagging directories, you can run a command in all repos with that tag. For example, gr @work status will run a git status (there is a built-in concise status command) in all repositories tagged “@work”, showing a one-line summary of each (with info on modifications and ahead/behind counts)
github.com
github.com
. You can also pass through any shell or git command, e.g. gr @work git fetch runs git fetch in each repo tagged @work
github.com
. Unlike some tools, gr doesn’t reinvent git subcommands – it delegates unknown commands directly, so your normal git usage works in bulk
github.com
.

Auto-Discovery of Repos: Gr can automatically scan your filesystem for Git repos and generate an initial tag config. Running gr tag discover searches under a given path (or your home directory by default, up to a certain depth) for all .git directories
github.com
. It then opens a list for you to assign tags to each found repo in your editor
github.com
. This makes setup easier – you don’t have to manually add repos one by one.

Extensibility via Plugins: The tool supports a plugin system and middleware for advanced use. You can write custom plugins (Node modules starting with meta-) to extend functionality
github.com
. The README mentions ideas like a REST API or other integrations via middleware
github.com
. However, by default the built-in commands are fairly minimal (mainly the tagging and status).

Missing/Limitations: As a Node.js tool, gr needs Node environment to run. It provides a good tagging mechanism, but has fewer purpose-built features beyond running commands and showing status. Advanced actions (like syncing or batch-PR creation) aren’t inbuilt. Also, its development is not very active lately (it met the author’s “limited needs”
github.com
). There’s no interactive UI; you edit a text file to manage tags and then use CLI commands.

Mani – Many-Repo Orchestration (Go CLI)

Mani is a newer CLI tool (written in Go) that uses a declarative config file (YAML) to manage multiple repositories and common tasks
dev.to
. It’s useful for microservices or many-project setups. Key features:

Declarative Config of Repos: Mani’s config (mani.yaml) lists your projects with their local path and optionally their git URL
dev.to
dev.to
. This serves as a centralized index of all repos in a workspace, including a short description of each. From this, Mani can clone all repositories in one command (e.g. mani sync to clone everything listed)
dev.to
. This makes onboarding easier – instead of a README with dozens of git clone URLs, a new developer can run one command to get all needed repos.

Batch Commands & Run Groups: You can define commonly used commands or scripts in the config as well. Mani allows running either ad-hoc shell commands or predefined commands on one, several, or all repos. For example, you might define a command to run tests or linters in each repo, then execute it across all at once. You can also filter by project tags or names (e.g. run only on backend services vs. frontends)
dev.to
. This helps when you want to, say, do git pull on all, or run npm install in only the JavaScript repos, etc.

Overview and Grouping: Mani can show an overview of all projects and defined commands, helping discover what’s available. It essentially standardizes the practice of having a bootstrap script – the config is like an onboarding script + documentation combined
dev.to
.

Missing/Limitations: Mani’s approach requires maintaining a YAML file, which is an extra step if your set of repos changes frequently. It’s not as real-time interactive – it’s more like a batch orchestrator. There is no built-in status dashboard; you would still run your defined commands (like a git status command group) to see repo statuses. Also, Mani is quite focused on executing tasks; it doesn’t natively highlight repo statuses or differences beyond what your commands do. There’s no native TUI/GUI for Mani (it’s purely command-driven).

Meta – Meta-Repository Tool (JavaScript)

Meta turns a folder into a “meta-repo” that contains multiple Git repos as subprojects. It’s popular in JavaScript circles as a compromise between monorepo and polyrepo
github.com
. How it works and features:

Meta Repository Structure: You create a meta repo which is a regular git repo that contains a configuration of child repos. Cloning a meta-repo can pull down all its sub-repos in one go. Instead of git clone, you run meta git clone <meta-repo-url> to fetch all defined projects
github.com
. This ensures everyone gets the full set of repos with one command. If new projects are added to the meta, teammates can do meta git update to pull the new repo into their local environment
github.com
.

Unified Commands via Plugins: Meta itself is lightweight; most functionality comes from plugins (published as npm packages prefixed with meta-)
github.com
. For instance, meta exec <cmd> runs an arbitrary shell command in each sub-repo concurrently
github.com
 – similar to other tools’ bulk execution. There are plugins for common needs: e.g. meta-project to add/remove projects, meta-bump to bump versions in all repos, meta-release, etc
github.com
. This modular approach lets you pick and choose capabilities.

Monorepo-like Workflows: Meta gives a monorepo “feel” (single unified worktree) while keeping separate git histories. For example, you can group related repos so developers always have consistent sets, and even run cross-repo scripts. It provides migration commands (like meta project migrate) to split a monorepo into many repos while preserving history
github.com
. It also supports parallel execution (meta exec can run tasks in parallel, improving speed for many repos)
github.com
.

Missing/Limitations: Meta is primarily geared towards orchestrating a set of repos that logically belong together (often used in front-end projects or microservices owned by one team). It might be overkill for loosely related personal repos. Also, as a Node.js tool with many plugins, it can be a bit complex to configure. There’s no built-in interactive UI; usage is through CLI and your text editor/IDE. In essence, Meta excels at initial setup and bulk tasks, but for day-to-day status viewing or cherry-picking changes, you’d still rely on git and other tools.

Google Repo (manifest tool) and vcstool – Manifest-Based Managers

Some tools manage multiple repos via a manifest file listing repositories and their sources:

Google’s Repo (Android) – Often just called repo, this is a Python tool used for Android’s AOSP project. You maintain a manifest.xml that lists dozens or hundreds of Git repositories with their URLs and target paths. The repo tool can then sync all repos (cloning or updating to specific revisions) with one command
stackoverflow.com
. It’s powerful for large projects – for example, “repo sync” will pull down all specified repositories at known good versions. Repo also has subcommands for branching across all projects, uploading changes for review, etc. However, it’s tailored to manifest-driven workflows; using it means committing to that manifest approach. (It’s great for consistent multi-repo states, but not as interactive for arbitrary tasks.)

vcstool (and wstool) – These are similar manifest-style tools from the ROS (Robot Operating System) community. vcstool uses YAML manifests (.repos files) to import or update multiple source repositories in one go. It supports git, hg, svn, bzr. For example, you maintain a YAML of repos (with names, URLs, version), then vcs import to clone them all, and vcs pull to update all. The older wstool did something similar with a .rosinstall file. These tools ensure a set of repos can be treated as a single “workspace” with deterministic versions (important for complex dependencies in robotics). They are very useful in their domain, but require the user to maintain the manifest file. They also lack interactive status display – the user typically knows which repos are in the set and uses vcs pull etc. (Note: Gita’s author explicitly compared gita to Repo and wstool, noting those required more effort to evaluate/configure
news.ycombinator.com
.)

Missing: Manifest tools are excellent for syncing large sets of repos, but they are missing a friendly UI or status overview. You typically need external scripts to check which repos have unpushed changes or differ from manifest. They’re also not aimed at ad-hoc grouping or quick bulk commands outside the manifest scope.

all-repos – Sweeping Changes Across Many Repos

all-repos (by asottile) is a specialized CLI tool for those who have dozens or hundreds of repos (like an organization’s libraries) and need to automate changes across all of them. Its focus is not on day-to-day status, but on bulk mechanical changes:

It can clone all repositories from a specified source (GitHub user/org, GitLab, etc.) into a local folder with one command
github.com
github.com
.

It provides commands to grep across all repos or find files across repos
github.com
github.com
, which is useful for discovering which projects need a certain fix.

Critically, it supports an all-repos-manual and related features to apply a code modification to every repo en masse. For example, you could write a script to update a dependency version, and all-repos can open each repo, apply the change, and even prepare commits. It’s effectively automating the “search and replace in 50 repos” scenario.

This tool is powerful for maintenance tasks and ensuring consistency across repos. However, it’s not really meant for interactively managing a handful of working repos; it’s more for large-scale repository automation.

Missing: All-repos is highly focused on automation and requires comfort with writing scripts/regex for changes. It doesn’t show a human-friendly dashboard of repo status; instead it’s for programmatic sweeping updates. It’s likely overkill for a small number of repos or for general daily workflow management.

GUI Applications for Multi-Repo Management

Graphical Git clients have started adding features to juggle multiple repos, though with varying degrees of support:

GitKraken – A popular cross-platform GUI, which introduced Workspaces to address multi-repo challenges. A Workspace lets you group multiple repositories in one view. GitKraken shows an organized list of repos with their branch and sync status (so you can see at a glance which repos have unpushed commits, which branch each is on, etc.)
gitkraken.com
. From a Workspace, you can perform actions across all repos: e.g. fetch or pull updates for every repo with one click, or open a new branch across multiple repos simultaneously
gitkraken.com
. This saves time over doing it one by one. GitKraken also integrates with issue trackers and PRs – it can list all Pull Requests and issues from all your linked repos in one interface
gitkraken.com
, giving a unified workflow. Essentially, GitKraken aims to eliminate the “multiple open terminals and windows” problem by serving as a central dashboard
gitkraken.com
gitkraken.com
. Missing: GitKraken (especially Pro version) is a paid tool, and some users find it heavy for quick tasks. It’s a full GUI, so not as lightweight as a terminal tool. Also, while it can batch-fetch or batch-open branches, more complex bulk operations (like “commit all changed repos at once”) are not typical – you’d still handle commits per repo (though the UI makes switching easy).

SourceTree – A free GUI by Atlassian. It allows managing multiple repos by opening each in tabs or windows, and you can define “Favorites” or groups of repositories. However, SourceTree historically has no one-click multi-repo update – users have requested a feature to fetch/pull all open repos at once
jira.atlassian.com
. Currently, you must click each repo and pull individually, which is tedious with many repos (there is an open suggestion for multi-select to pull all
jira.atlassian.com
). SourceTree’s strength is visualizing history, not multi-repo orchestration. Missing: Lacks bulk actions (fetch/pull all, etc.), and doesn’t show an overview of all repos’ statuses together – you have to click each repository’s tab to see its status.

Tower – A paid Git GUI (Mac/Windows). Tower focuses on clean UI for single repos, but it does let you open multiple repository tabs and quickly switch between them. It has features like a global commit search across repos and a sidebar listing all your repositories. You can perform batch operations on selected repos in Tower’s sidebar (for example, selecting multiple repos and hitting “fetch” might fetch all – Tower 3 added some multi-repo features in its GUI). However, like SourceTree, there’s no combined working copy view – it’s more about convenience switching. Missing: No consolidated multi-repo status dashboard; operations like committing still happen one repo at a time.

SmartGit – A cross-platform paid GUI known for strong multi-repo support. SmartGit has a Repositories view that shows all your local repositories in a tree and indicates which have new commits, etc.
docs.syntevo.com
. You can select a group of repos and perform actions like “Pull All” on that group
smartgit.userecho.com
. It also supports pushing to multiple remotes at once
docs.syntevo.com
. For projects using Git submodules, SmartGit can even commit or sync parent and submodules together
smartgit.userecho.com
. Missing: SmartGit doesn’t combine repos beyond those group operations – e.g., you can’t view combined diffs. Also it’s commercial software and can be complex for beginners.

RepoZ – An open-source Windows tool that takes a unique approach: it auto-discovers all Git repos on your machine and keeps a running list of them
stackoverflow.com
. It provides a GUI list (and a command-line helper) showing each repo’s name, path, current branch, and whether it has uncommitted changes or needs a pull
stackoverflow.com
stackoverflow.com
. RepoZ will automatically track when you clone new repos or switch branches, updating the list in real-time. It has a context menu to perform actions on one or many repos (on Windows you can multi-select repos and choose “Fetch” or “Pull” to update all selected at once)
stackoverflow.com
. A standout feature is Auto-Fetch: RepoZ can periodically fetch all repos in the background to keep your indicators (ahead/behind status) up to date without manual effort
stackoverflow.com
. This helps ensure you know if any local repo is behind the remote. Missing: RepoZ is currently Windows-only and primarily a status tracker + launcher (you can double-click a repo in the list to open a shell or IDE in that repo). It doesn’t provide deeper Git functions like resolving merge conflicts or staging changes – you’d still jump into your Git client or terminal for those. Essentially it fills the gap of awareness (“Which repos need attention?”) but not the actual Git operations beyond fetch/pull.

Other GUIs: GitKraken, SourceTree, Tower, and SmartGit are some of the main GUI solutions. GitHub Desktop (and GitLab’s client) are designed for simplicity – they can open multiple repos but only work on one at a time (no batch operations across repos). Visual Studio Code isn’t a dedicated Git client but with its source control panel it can detect multiple repos in a workspace folder and show each separately; still, actions like staging or committing are per-repo. Visual Studio 2022 (IDE) recently introduced an optional multi-repo mode where you can have up to 10 active repos and even commit to all of them in one step (“Commit All” for multiple repos)
devblogs.microsoft.com
. That is an exception where an IDE allows a single commit dialog to apply to all modified repos, but this is relatively new and not common in other tools.

Common Gaps and Opportunities

Despite the variety of tools, there are some gaps that a new TUI tool (e.g. in Rust with Ratatui) could fill:

Lack of a True TUI: There isn’t a widely-used terminal UI app dedicated to multi-repo management. Users must choose between command-line scripts (no UI) or full GUIs. A curses-style TUI could combine the best of both: a lightweight, keyboard-driven interface with a visual overview of repos. For instance, one Reddit user explicitly asked for “something with a UI that can show... which branch they’re on etc.” for multiple repos
reddit.com
 – existing tools only partially satisfy this (RepoZ does, but not on Linux/macOS; GitKraken does, but it’s GUI and not terminal). A cross-platform TUI could be “nicer” by giving quick navigation and commands in one terminal screen.

Integrated Status + Action Dashboard: Many CLI tools either focus on status (gita, RepoZ) or on executing commands (mr, mu-repo, all-repos), but few combine both seamlessly. A new tool could present an interactive list of repos (like gita/RepoZ) where you can see statuses and then trigger actions on selected repos. For example, you might navigate to a repo in a TUI list and press a key to fetch it or open an interactive diff. This merges the discovery and the action phases that are separate in most current solutions.

Auto-Discovery and Easy Setup: A pain point with several tools is configuration – adding each repo manually. Auto-discovery of Git repos (like RepoZ and gr provide) is a killer feature that could be more widely applied. A “nicer” tool might automatically find repos in common locations or allow drag-and-drop addition (in a TUI sense). This ensures new repositories aren’t overlooked (developers often forget to add a repo to their multi-repo tool config).

Batch Commit/Unified Operations: One rarely addressed feature is committing changes across multiple repos in one step. Usually, commits are kept separate per repo (for good reason – different histories). But there are scenarios (like a cross-cutting change to several services) where a tool could at least coordinate the process: e.g. present a combined diff of all modified files across repos, then let the user enter a commit message once and apply it to each repo individually. Visual Studio’s multi-repo support hints at this by allowing one commit action to commit in all checked-out repos at once
devblogs.microsoft.com
. A TUI tool could implement something similar for Git (perhaps warn if any repo’s commit fails). This is largely missing in today’s tools – developers resort to manual looping or scripts.

Cross-Repo Diff and Search: While all-repos offers grep/find across repos, a user-friendly way to search for a string in all tracked repos and see results (perhaps in an interactive pane) would be valuable. Also, if a file name or config needs to be compared across repos, a TUI could streamline that. Currently one would run shell scripts or use an IDE’s “Find in path” over multiple folders.

Unified Notifications: Another angle – if one repository in your set has new remote changes or a CI failure, a unified tool could highlight that. RepoZ’s auto-fetch provides a form of this (showing ahead/behind counts)
stackoverflow.com
. GitKraken’s Workspace shows which repos have PRs or issues needing attention
gitkraken.com
. A “nicer alternative” might integrate with Git hooks or CI status to flag repos that need love.

Performance and Cross-Platform: Implementing in Rust could yield a snappy tool that handles dozens of repos without lag. Some existing tools (written in Python or Node) can be slower, especially when querying many repos in sequence. A Rust TUI could utilize concurrency to fetch statuses quickly and stay responsive. Also, it would naturally be cross-platform (command-line based), whereas some GUI solutions are OS-specific.

In summary, there are many tools addressing multi-repo management, each with strengths: CLI tools provide automation and scripting, while GUIs provide visualization. But no single tool perfectly covers all needs. User feedback often centers on wanting less manual effort to keep repos in sync (e.g. “update all git repositories with as few actions as possible”
jira.atlassian.com
) and better overview of project state. A new Rust TUI app could outshine alternatives by combining an intuitive overview (like a dashboard of repos and their statuses) with powerful batch operations, all in a fast, keyboard-driven interface. By learning from each existing solution’s features and shortcomings, one can create a tool that is truly “nicer than the alternatives.”
